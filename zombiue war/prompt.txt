A gritty post-apocalyptic action scene featuring a lone survivor sitting injured on cracked asphalt, leaning against the rear of a bullet-riddled black Mercedes E500 with its back window shattered. The survivor, a rugged young man with long dark hair and a determined expression, aims a handgun toward approaching danger. Surrounding the car are a group of terrifying zombies with decayed skin, tattered clothes, and menacing poses, closing in from all directions. Early morning blue light casts long shadows across an abandoned cityscape with tall buildings in the distance. Dust, debris, and broken glass scatter across the ground. Intense cinematic atmosphere, high contrast lighting, ultra-detailed textures, dramatic tension, action-movie poster style, 8K, hyper-realistic.
