A cinematic top-down portrait of a young woman standing on a solid deep green floor, captured from an extreme overhead angle. She looks up directly at the camera with wide, expressive eyes, creating an intimate and slightly surreal mood. She wears a soft white bucket hat, a cozy oversized green-and-beige checkered sweater, blue jeans, and white sneakers. Minimalist composition with vast negative space surrounding her, emphasizing isolation and calm. Soft diffused studio lighting, natural skin tones, subtle shadows, clean color grading with earthy greens, editorial fashion photography style, ultra-sharp focus, high resolution, modern aesthetic, cinematic framing, shot on a professional DSLR, shallow depth of field, Instagram poster vibe
