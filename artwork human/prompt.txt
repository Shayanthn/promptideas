"A surreal photorealistic artwork of a giant human
eye filling the entire background, with hyper-detailed eyelashes, skin texture, and reflections on the glossy iris. A tiny woman sits casually on the lower eyelid as if it were a ledge,perfectly integrated into the scene. She wears cargo pants, tan boots, a grey long-sleeve shirt,
and carries a camo sling bag. Her pose is relaxed,
hands resting on the eyelid surface, with soft shadows matching the lighting. Extreme macro scale contrast between the enormous eye and the miniature human figure. Ultra-realistic textures, crisp details, dramatic depth of field, studio lighting, surreal atmosphere, high-resolution poster design, cinematic composition."
