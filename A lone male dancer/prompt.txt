A lone male dancer inspired by Michael Jackson, captured mid-pose in a dark, empty stage, head tilted down, one leg crossed gracefully, hands in pockets. He wears a loose white silk shirt with an open collar and tailored white trousers, softly flowing with motion. Electric blue ethereal energy and smoky aura surround his body, glowing like lightning and mist, outlining his silhouette. His curly hair falls naturally over his face, creating a mysterious, emotional mood. Dramatic low-key lighting with a cool blue color palette, deep shadows, subtle rim light, and cinematic contrast. Ultra-realistic digital painting, hyper-detailed fabric texture, volumetric smoke, glowing particles, smooth gradients, dark minimal background, 4K, masterpiece, cinematic poster style, fine art realism.
